<small>Examples of the use of transitions to navigate long distances. D2 used a meander transition in the middle of the piece to connect two sections; within a section, neighbouring states are connected using crossfades. A5 used a crossfade and a meander transition to navigate between two neighbourhoods in the cloud, each corresponding to a section in their piece. (a) Composition by D2 (detail), Sound_example_4.m4a in the sound material. (b) Composition by A5 (detail), Sound_example_5.m4a in the sound material.

<small>The space distribution of these two compositions gives information about how the sound evolves in time. While composer D3 created a gradual and constant evolution by navigating the whole point cloud using the meander transition, B3 was interested in exploring local variations and nuances. This difference can be seen by the fact that the viewpoint is zoomed far out in (a), while it is much closer to the cloud in (b).</small>

#### Neural Audio Instruments

<br>

Neural Audio is a category of deep learning pipelines which output audio signals directly, in real-time scenarios of action-sound interactions

<br>

We define neural audio instruments as Digital Musical Instruments that embed neural network and deep learning approaches capable of directly generating or transforming audio signals, and enabling real-time action–sound mapping.

#### Neural Audio Instruments

The six takeaways from our conceptualization of neural audio instruments:

- Stand on the shoulders of giants
- Search for new modes of interaction
- Challenge dualities
- Embrace inexplicability (with a grain of salt)
- Make AI inconspicuous

<small>Neural audio instruments: Epistemological and phenomenological perspectives on musical embodiment of deep learning. Frontiers in Computer Science, 7. https://doi.org/10.3389/fcomp.2025.1575168</small>

---

**0.Stand on the shoulders of giants**

- All the core insights from the DMI literature remain relevant 
- Challenges like the control bottleneck and the symbolic nature of action-to-sound can become more pronounced under AI/ML conditions 
- Established guidance on fostering embodiment in DMIs still applies here as a vital starting point!

---

**1.Search for new modes of interaction.** 
   
- The behaviors and “materials” of any instrument strongly condition how musicians interact with it 
- Neural networks, however, may exhibit properties not easily paralleled in earlier instruments. 
- Novel paradigms, such as directly “traversing” multi-dimensional latent spaces, might offer fresh avenues for mapping movement and cognition to sonic outcomes

---

**2.Challenge dualities**

- A pressing and practical concern for DMIs lies in the traditional control–synthesis divide and the predicate of mapping. 
- We do not suggest abandoning mapping altogether; exploration of how gesture connects to sound is a valuable design tool. 
- We advocate a holistic design perspective where sound and gesture are conceived as a unified entity from the outset, rather than as two separate “containers” later bound by mapping 

---

**3.Embrace inexplicability (with a grain of salt).**
   
- While research on explainable AI is undoubtedly worthwhile, non-explainability can play a significant role in the use and design of neural audio instruments.
- Performers and even designers of neural audio systems may choose to focus on musical outcomes rather than dissecting every underlying process. 
- Indeed, not all instrument designs are “predicated on the application of scientific knowledge” (Green, 2011) and a certain measure of “unknowing” can inspire extraordinary results. 
- This notion also resonates with broader human-computer interaction discourse on the creative power of ignorance (Grammenos, 2014) (ranging from lack of preconceptions, to true ignorance), where “if you already know where you are going, you are not going someplace new.”

---

**4. Make AI inconspicuous.**

- When the AI is not intended to act as a distinct musical agent, making its presence explicit may be unnecessary or even counterproductive.
- Designers might treat neural audio models as just another invisible part of the instrument's anatomy, like the string of a piano or the integrated circuit of an analog synthesizer. 
- By letting the model manifest itself only through the embodiment of the musician's actions and intentions, the performer can experience a unified instrument rather than a model endowed with conspicuous (artificial) intelligence
- By rendering the model seamlessly integral, designers promote an experience of playing an instrument rather than interfacing with an AI model.

#### Understanding Co-Storytelling with Large Language Models (LLMs)

<small> AI Dungeon (<https://play.aidungeon.com/>)  is a text-based adventure game that uses a large language model to generate dynamic and interactive storytelling experiences. Players can input any action or dialogue, and the AI responds with narrative developments, creating a unique story each time. This game exemplifies how LLMs can be used for co-storytelling, allowing players to collaboratively create narratives with the AI in real-time. </small>

#### Understanding Co-Storytelling with Large Language Models (LLMs)

![align-center width:800](img/llm-research-design.png)

---

#### Understanding Co-Storytelling with Large Language Models (LLMs)

- Users treat LLM co-storytelling as interactive play
- AI imperfections (repetition, incoherence, abrupt shifts, incompleteness) came forward as creative affordances rather than failures.
- Players perceive the AI as a semi-autonomous collaborator in a story that is written together
- User experience revolves around shifting agency between the machine and the player
- Users develop strategies for controlling or guiding the LLM via narrative perspective, prompts, and system features (Story Cards, World Info, Author’s Notes).
- Multimodal storytelling is emerging, with image generation expanding narrative expression.
- Highlights: Wabi-sabi (imperfection appreciation), anthropomorphism/power dynamics, and the game–tool duality of LLM storytelling systems.

#### Towards Computationally Creative Game Design

![bg right width:650](img/co-occurrence-network.jpg)

Reviewed 236 studies on learning-based AI in game design

While AI technologies are widely applied for functional and procedural tasks, **creativity remains underexplored**

We investigated the correlation between the appearance of creativity-related terms and their co-occurrence with other keywords. 

The co-occurrence network here visualizes the relationships and connections between frequently co-occurring keywords within the same article.

#### Grounding Machine Creativity in Game Design Knowledge Representations
*Empirical Probing of LLM-Based Executable Synthesis of Goal Playable Patterns under Structural Constraints*

We investigated whether large language models can translate structured game‑design knowledge—specifically goal‑pattern  abstractions—into executable Unity game scenes

**Game Development Framing:** Digital game development as a computational creativity activity, in which design‑pattern abstractions and game engine constraints guide the creation of an executable, playable game
**Execution‑grounded evaluation pipeline:** An end‑to‑end workflow (LLM generation → Unity batch compilation → log‑based failure analysis) for assessing executable viability at scale.
**Insights on human–machine knowledge boundaries:** Game design pattern knowledge injection increases structural complexity requirement at generation, revealing a tension in how domain knowledge should be injected into generative systems.

#### Bringing the Body Back to AI Voice and Speech Technologies

Susan Bennett and Jon Briggs provided voice recordings for GM Voices, which were later licensed to ScanSoft.

Their voice datasets were then later allegedly used to build the voice
of the American Siri (Bennett) and British Siri (Briggs) through speech concatenation.

Apple has never confirmed, nor denied whether they utilised Bennett’s concatenated speech data, nor Briggs’. In the case of Bennett, audio forensics expert Ed Primeau studied recordings of Siri and blind recordings of Bennett’s voice and presented his the conclusion of his analysis that “They are identical – a 100 % match.”

#### Bringing the Body Back to AI Voice and Speech Technologies

- Integrating voice rights into personality rights frameworks
- The data frameworks for voice should be designed to have direct connection to their source body
- Similarity should be revisited, where nations take their own stances through democratic processes
